# Catmull-Rom Spline Visualization

**Author:** Vikash Kumar

## About

This is an OpenGL C++ application that visualizes Catmull-Rom splines. The program reads control points from a text file and generates smooth curves that pass through these points. The spline is rendered with texture mapping, creating a textured path along the curve using normal vectors calculated at each point.

## Setup

1. Install OpenGL and GLUT libraries
2. Ensure `points.txt` and `snake.png` are in the same directory
3. Run: `splines.cpp`
